Nowadays, using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 
The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which 6 participants did the exercise. This document describes the process analysis applied.
